DeepInverse Documentation
=======================================

DeepInverse is a Pytorch based library for solving imaging inverse problems with deep learning. This library provides a large collection of predefined imaging operators (magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, compressed sensing, blurring, inpainting, etc.), popular supervised and unsupervised learning losses (noise2x, equivariant imaging, etc.) and unrolled architectures (ADMM, forward-backward, deep equilibrium, etc.).
