# `DeepInv` - A python library of deep learning methods for inverse problems

## Overview

Inverse problems are ubiquitous in scientific imaging and signal processing. Although deep learning has achieved significant success in many imaging problems, a comprehensive and timely library is still missing. `DeepInv` will implement the most mainstream deep learning approaches for imaging, from supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised methods. We hope people could effectively solve their inverse problems by simply calling DeepInv's APIs which should be very easy to setup and friendly to use.
